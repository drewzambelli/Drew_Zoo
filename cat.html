            Domestic house cats (<i>Felis catus</i>) are small, carnivorous mammals known 
            for their agility, sharp senses, and independent yet affectionate nature. 
            They have been companions to humans for thousands of years - roughly 7500 years - 
            living in homes across the world in a variety of breeds, colors, and coat patterns.

            Cats are skilled hunters, using their keen eyesight, excellent hearing, and
            retractable claws to stalk and capture prey, such as rodents and birds. 
            Despite being domesticated, many of their instincts remain intact, and 
            they exhibit playful behaviors that mimic their hunting techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cats are valued not only as pets but also for their roles in controlling 
            pest populations. Their ability to form close bonds with humans, coupled 
            with their low-maintenance care needs, has made them one of the most popular 
            and beloved animals in households around the world.
